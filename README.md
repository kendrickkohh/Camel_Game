# Camel
You're stuck in the Sahara Desert running away from natives who want to steal your camel. Make moves to escape from the natives but be sure to watch your camel's tiredness and your thirst, don't get caught!  Camel is a small game I made using if statements and the random library, the aim of the game is to escape the natives who constantly chase after you, you have moves that allow you to run away from the natives but cause other conditions such as your camel's tiredness to increase. Using the different options available you can prevent your camel or your character from dying out, hope you enjoy the game!
